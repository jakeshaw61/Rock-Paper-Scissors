## User Experience

### User Stories

### As a site creator:
- I want to make the site visually appealing upon first impression, so the user is interested in returning to the site.
- I want to make the site easy to navigate for the user.
- I want the user to be able to easily understand how to play the game.

### As a first time user:
- I want to be able to have fun palying the game.
- I want to be able to easily understand how to play.
- I want to be able to keep trying to improve my score.

### As a returning user:
- I want to feel that i am familiar with the site.  
- I want to be able to remember how to play. 

## Design 
I wanted a minimalist overall design with large icons and a simple colour scheme so the focus remains on the game and doesnt confuse the user.

### Colour Scheme

I chose a dark grey background for the site with white text and icons. This white text stands out and creates a good contrast against the background. 

### Typography
I have used 1 font throughout the site which is called Play, it is from Google fonts. I chose this font at is easy to read and also has a gaming impression. I choose Sans Serif as a fallback font. 

### Icons 
- I chose 3 icons from FontAwesome which represent rock, paper and scissors. I used these icons as visual aid for the user when making their choice.

## Wireframes 
I used Balsamiq to make some wireframes of how I wanted the site to look. Making the wireframes was very useful as I was able to imagine what the pages and features would look like on different size screens.

## Testing 
I have tested the site on Chrome, Safari and Firefox and all the feautues work as intened. I have also tested on mobile sizes and tablet. I designed the site using a mobile first approach so all the features work the same on small size devices as they do larger sizes. 

### Html 
I used the [W3C Markup Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my HTML. No errors were found.
 
### CSS
I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS. No errors were found. 

### JavaScript
I used the [Jshint Validator](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JaveScript. No errors were found. The following metrics were returned:
- There are 5 functions in this file.
- Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 0.
- Largest function has 21 statements in it, while the median is 6.
- The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 14 while the median is 1.

### Lighthouse 
I used Chromes Dev Tools lighthouse feasture to run the site throught to test for Performance, Accessability, Best Practices and SEO.

### Responsive 
I used a mobile first approach when designing the site, starting off at the smallest screen size of 320px and scaling it up to screen sizes larger than 1200px. I used Flex-Box throughout the site, so when i came to the media queries i only had to make some simple changes like flex-direction or justify-content to make it responsive for other screen sizes. 

## Deployment 
The site was deployed to GitHub pages, the steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages setion and from the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch and click save.
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
